about: By the end of my Ph.D. I had gathered 5 years of experience in Object-Oriented Programming, primarily in Python. A workshop in Web Development inspired me to apply my programming skills to build responsive, multi-functional websites. Having completed a few projects and more than 100 <a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/james-leung/">LeetCode</a>  problems, I believe I am well equipped to become a software developer, with a focus on web applications. My rigorous scientific education also gives me an edge in solving abstract technical problems.

about: Towards the end of my Ph.D. I had gathered 5 years of experience in Object-Oriented Programming, primarily in Python. A workshop in Web Development inspired me to apply my programming skills to build practical, multi-functional websites. Having completed a few projects and more than 100 LeetCode questions, I believe I am well equipped to become a software developer, with a focus on developing web applications. My rigorous scientific education also gives me an edge in solving abstract technical problems.

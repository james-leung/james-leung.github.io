about: As a full-stack developer with 3 years of industry experience, I've worked on multiple projects in Agile environments, including a public-sector job site, a driver licence management system, and an employee holiday booking system. My rigorous scientific education also gives me an edge in solving abstract technical problems. I believe in constant learning and look forward to working in a company committed to upskilling their developers.
